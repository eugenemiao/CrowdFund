### **Crowdfund is a full-stack app that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a project successfully receiving funding from online crowdfunding platforms.**


## Overview

#### Users can use this app to 1) find a reasonable monetary goal based on the number of people they plan to reach, or 2) implement a more aggressive marketing strategy if their goal is fixed but the number of expected backers is too low to ensure success.


## Inspiration

#### The Crowdfund app was built as a tool for people who plan to fund their projects through online crowdfunding resources like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo.
